## Welcome

Hello, on my GitHub you can find some of the projects I have worked on, most of them as part of my MS Intelligent Systems studies. Several works were done collaborating with my friend, [Levkovich Uria](https://github.com/uriaLevko).

1. [Sentiment analysis on large-scale vaccine-related tweets using PySpark](https://github.com/rotembaruch/twitter-bot-detection). Collecting by Twitter API V2 about 1M tweets with academic research access during the first year of COVID19. Performing text preprocessing cleaning and employing TextBlob tool for semantic valuing. Used Spark for programming data parallelism and GCP for cloud computing.

2. [Product recommendation system using word2vec embedding](https://github.com/rotembaruch/Product-Recommendation-System). Conducting a word2vec embedding algorithm on sequential purchased items, which aims to learn the semantic relationships between the items. By extracting the probability vector from a trained logistic regression model, the system offers the customer three to five relevant items.

3. [Semi-supervised anomaly detection by variational-autoencoder (VAE)](https://github.com/rotembaruch/Semi-Supervised-Anomaly-Detection-by-Variational-Autoencoder-). Training a VAE model with only "normal" instances, creating a "normal model". Performing hyperparameter tuning with a validation set on the VAE reconstruction error, which measures how test instances are "far" from the "normal mode".

4. [Topic modeling](https://github.com/rotembaruch/Gibbs-And-NMF-For-Topic-Modeling) is an unsupervised machine learning for clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents. In this study, we examined two different topic modeling algorithms, Gibbs and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). To test the models, we performed several experiments on two well-known datasets with different structures, and for evaluating the performance, we used a coherence score.

5. [Self-Attention layers in deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)](https://github.com/rotembaruch/Self--Attention-Layers-in-Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversarial-Networks). Comparing GAN models with and without self-attention layers, which intend to add a dimension of memory to the model for generating images with better spatial significance. The measurement tool we used to measure the generated image quality is FID.

6. [Speaker gender identification using pitch-based features extraction](https://github.com/rotembaruch/rotembaruch-Speaker-Gender-Identification-Using-Pitch-based-Features-Extraction).

## Welcome

Hello, on my GitHub you can find some of the projects I have worked on, most of them as part of my MS Intelligent Systems studies. Several works were done collaborating with my friend, [Levkovich Uria](https://github.com/uriaLevko).

1. A python library for implementing the model that [Dr. Hen Hajaj](https://scholar.google.co.il/citations?user=Zy2cIskAAAAJ&hl=en) and I presented in the paper: [**SimCSE for Encrypted Traffic Classification and Zero-Day Attack Detection**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9780135).

2. [Topic modeling](https://github.com/rotembaruch/Gibbs-And-NMF-For-Topic-Modeling) is an unsupervised machine learning for clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents. In this study, we examined two different topic modeling algorithms, Gibbs and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). To test the models, we performed several experiments on two well-known datasets with different structures, and for evaluating the performance, we used a coherence score.

3. [Semi-supervised nomaly detection by variational-autoencoder (VAE)](https://github.com/rotembaruch/Semi-Supervised-Anomaly-Detection-by-Variational-Autoencoder-). In this project, the VAE model learned in the training stage only normal samples to create a "normal model". To find anomalies in the test data, we used the error function of the VAE model as a measure of how the test samples are "far" from the "normal model". We performed hyper-parameter tuning on the validation-set to get a error function that will give the best separation for finding anomalies.

4. [Self-Attention layers in deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)](https://github.com/rotembaruch/Self--Attention-Layers-in-Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversarial-Networks). This study examines the effect of adding self-attention layers to a GAN model. Self-Attention layers intend to add a dimension of memory to the model for generating images with better spatial significance. The measurement tool we used to measure the generated images quality is FID.

5. [Sentiment analysis on large-scale vaccine-related tweets using PySpark](https://github.com/rotembaruch/twitter-bot-detection). The work can be divided into two phases. The first is collecting about 1M vaccine-related tweets using the Twitter API, and the second is performing sentiment analysis on the collected data. Since it is large-scale data (big data), this work was done using PySpark and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

6. A small project to practice the use of Apache Kafka. In this work, we performed a [semantic analysis](https://github.com/rotembaruch/Semantic-analysis-with-Apache-Kafka) on the famous play Romeo and Juliet with batches of 100-line. The semantic analysis was performed according to the AFINN dictionary.

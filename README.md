## Welcome

Hello, on my GitHub you can find some of the projects I have worked on, most of them as part of my MS Intelligent Systems studies. Several works were done collaborating with my friend, [Levkovich Uria](https://github.com/uriaLevko).

1. **Topic modeling** is an unsupervised machine learning for clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents. In this study, we examined two different topic modeling models, Gibbs and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). To test the models, we performed several experiments on two well-known datasets with different structures, and for evaluating the performance, we used a coherence score.

2. **Semi-supervised anomaly detection by variational-autoencoder (VAE)**. In this project, the VAE model learned in the training phase only normal samples to create a "normal model". To find anomalies in the test data, we used the error function of the VAE model as a measure of how much the test samples are far from the "normal model". To get a function that will give the best separation for finding anomalies, we examined a different weight for the parameters representing the two error components.

3. **Self-Attention layers in deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)**. This study examines the effect of adding self-attention layers to a GAN model. Self-Attention layers intend to add a dimension of memory to the model for generating images with better spatial significance. The measurement tool we used to measure the generated images quality is FID.
